# SI100b-Python-Statistics-Project---Relationship between Economics and Food industry
## Background
### Food industry shed light on the Economy
> There is a Chinese idiom saying '民以食为天'. The price of food can somehow show the living standards of the mass. How much are they related
### Big Mac Index
> The Big Mac Index is a price index published since 1986 by The Economist as an informal way of measuring the purchasing power parity (PPP) between two currencies and providing a test of the extent to which market exchange rates result in goods costing the same in different countries. It "seeks to make exchange-rate theory a bit more digestible." The index compares the relative price worldwide to purchase the Big Mac, a hamburger sold at McDonald's restaurants.<sup>1</sup>
### 10 Most valuable quick service restaurant brands worldwide
In the late 2021, these are the most valuable quick service restaurant brands worldwide.<sup>2</sup>
And without losing universality, we choose the first 6 brands whose values are more than 10 billion U.S. dollars. 
| Rank    |       Brand name      | Value  (billion $)  |
|  ----   | ----                  | -----               |
| 1       |     McDonald's        |    15.4921          |
| 2       |        Starbucks      | 6.0267              |
| 3       |        KFC            | 1.8189              |
| 4       |       Subway          | 1.4762              |
| 5       |     Domino's Pizza    | 1.2397              |
| 6       |        Chipolto       | 1.1996              |
    
### Research phase
From the table above we can see MacDonald's is absolutely the most competitive. But is the Big Mac Index as competitve as the brand itself?
In this project, we aim at finding other 'index's of the following 5 brands, to explore whether they can reflect the economy in each country or region. 
We will explore in the following steps,
1. Choose the most wide-spread and popular products of each brands and obtain their prices in our selected countries after 2000. 
2.   
3. 
4.
