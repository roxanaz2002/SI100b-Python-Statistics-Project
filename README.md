# Relationship between Economics and Food industry
## Background
### Food industry shed light on the Economy
> There is a Chinese idiom saying '民以食为天'. The price of food can somehow show the **living standards** of the mass. How much are they related to a country's **economic** condition or the people's living condition? Different institutes have published many indices based on different products, finding the most proper item to indicate the social development. Such as **Tall Latte index** from Starbucks coffee, **Big Mac Index** from the McDonald's. Later there are **iPod index**, **IKEA's Billy bookshelf Index** etc.

### Big Mac Index
> The Big Mac Index is a price index published since 1986 by The Economist as an informal way of measuring the purchasing power parity (PPP) between two currencies and providing a test of the extent to which market exchange rates result in goods costing the same in different countries. It "seeks to make exchange-rate theory a bit more digestible." The index compares the relative price worldwide to purchase the Big Mac, a hamburger sold at McDonald's restaurants.<sup>1</sup>
